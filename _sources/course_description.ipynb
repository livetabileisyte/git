    "Course description\n",
    "==================\n",
    "\n",
    "The course provides an accessible hands-on introduction to data science techniques, skills, and workflows necessary to perform open, reproducible, and ethical data analysis. In the course, you will study research problems of real-world relevance, such as vaccine hesitancy and the impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on human mobility. You will use real-world social data, including large-scale anonymised mobility data from digital sources and recent COVID-19 survey data. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will engage with open reproducible data science workflows using open-source and free computational tools, including the Python programming language, Jupyter notebook in the Cloud, Markdown, version control, and the Open Science Framework. No software installation or setup is required as you will use cloud computing. Specifically, you will use Jupyter notebooks on your laptop or tablet (or even smartphone) via free cloud environments such as the Google Colaboratory (Colab) or JupyterHub. Fortunately, the Python data science community have developed an open source ecosystem of libraries for data analysis, statistical modelling, machine learning, and network analysis, including the libraries `pandas`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, and `networkX`. This suite of libraries will allow us to analyse, visualise, and model data at easy, with minimal programming requirements, while focusing on reproducible analysis of social data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of all, this course aims to create inclusive, diverse, and supportive learning environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key themes\n",
    "Throughout the course, you will learn, in an accessible way, practical data science skills, including data wrangling, clustering, resampling, and visualisation of various data sources as well as applications of techniques from machine learning (e.g., cross-validation to mitigate the risk of overfitting), causal inference (e.g., causal graphs to detect confounding), and network analysis (e.g., community detection to discover tightly knit communities). The content is organised around four foundational data science tasks — (i) data preprocessing, (ii) description (and exploratory data analysis and visualisation), (iii) prediction, and (iv) causal inference (which includes counterfactuals). Attention is given to model evaluation and problems of overfitting, selection bias, confounding, and computational reproducibility. Throughout the course are discussed issues of data ethics, privacy, and fairness of data science models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course teaches you how to critically evaluate data and biases intrinsic to real-world data and real-time data (many of the COVID-19 data set we use are updated daily). Instead of looking for 'positive' results and 'statistically significant' relationships as a way of finding order in often disorderly data, you will learn open and reproducible workflow. In this workflow, you will describe your steps throughout the research process (not just your final results), make transparent choices of parameter selection, and document in your notebooks the results you have obtained, however 'useful' or '(un)expected' they may seem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "Prior knowledge of programming is not required as coding for data analysis will be taught from first principles. Background in mathematics or statistics are not required beyond basic algebra and descriptive statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Who this course is for\n",
    "The course would be ideal for students in the social sciences, public health, and related fields who want to study real-world problems using diverse data sets but lack data science knowledge and coding skill. In fact, the course could also be titled _Reproducible Data Science with Python for Social Scientists with Questions_.\n",

    "# What is Reproducible Data Science? \n",
    "\n",
    "The course is designed around an understanding of data science as the use of coding to draw conclusions from diverse data sets by solving five classes of tasks (see [Ani Adhikari and John DeNero, 2020](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/01/what-is-data-science.html); [Hernán et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1080/09332480.2019.1579578)): \n",
    "1. _Data preprocessing_ — preparing data for analysis using techniques for data cleaning, data wrangling, and data transformation.\n",
    "2. _Description_ — discovering patterns in data using exploratory data analysis, visualisation, and automated discovery techniques.\n",
    "3. _Prediction_ — using information about outcomes we know to make informed guesses about unknown outcomes by applying techniques from simple regression to (supervised) machine learning.\n",
    "4. _Causal data analysis_ — studying cause-and-effect questions via the application of causal graphs, counterfactuals, and causal inference techniques.\n",
    "5. _Inference_ — quantifying our degree of certainty to determine whether what we find in our data will hold among different scenarios using resampling methods and related techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course does not cover a single data science task in detail but introduces you to these tasks with a focus on real-world data and applications, hands-on computation, and reproducible data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a typical [Data Science Lifecycle](https://www.textbook.ds100.org/ch/01/lifecycle_intro.html), we will begin with a research question, and then select our data set(s), preprocess the data, perform descriptive analysis to explore basic features of our data, and then model our data to predict an outcome or establish causal effect. Throughout the data science lifecycle, transparency of research process and computational reproducibility are essential. \n",
    "\n",
    "This understanding of data science is inspired by many, including the UC Berkeley's data science program, particularly the courses [Data 8: Foundations of Data Science](http://data8.org/sp21) and [Data 100: Principles and Techniques of Data Science](https://ds100.org), and the associated open educational resources and communities; Matthew Salganik's book [Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/preface/); The Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science by Chris Bail and Matt Salganik and associated [learning resources](https://sicss.io/overview); Ramesh Johari's course at Stanford University [Fundamentals of Data Science](https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande226/); The Turing Way Community and their [Turing Way: A Handbook for Reproducible Data Science](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome). Finally, the UC Berkeley's 2020 [Workshop on Data Science Education](https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/resources/data-science-education-resources/2020-national-workshop-data-science-education) was instrumental in building both my vision and toolkit for democratising data science.\n",

A great feature of Python (and other open-source programing languages) are the collaborative communities which have developed a diverse ecosystem of powerful libraries or tools for doing data science. Those open-source tools allow us to perform computational data analysis at easy while focusing on the understanding of our results and on their evaluation and implications. The open-source tools for data analysis we will use the most include [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html) for data loading, wrangling, and exploratory data analysis; [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/#) and [`Matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org) for data visualisation; [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) for prediction, pattern discovery and other machine learning tasks; and [`statsmodels`](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) for statistical modelling.
